                    <p className='text-xl mt-2'>
                        BBALCO's growth is anchored in a well-planned financial and
                        operational architecture that emphasises self-sufficiency, risk
                        insulation, and long-term capital efficiency. As the Company
                        undertakes a large-scale expansion, it has already secured
                        critical enablers such as captive power, water, and logistics
                        infrastructure to support future operations without additional
                        cost burden or execution delays.
                        This strategic foresight ensures that growth is not dependent
                        on volatile external inputs. With minimal reliance on external
                        borrowings and strong internal accruals, BALCO is able to fund
                        progress while maintaining financial stability. The combination
                        of operational readiness and disciplined capital allocation
                        places the Company in a unique position to scale without
                        compromising financial strength.

                                As part of our ESG efforts, we have implemented a standardised governance framework aligned with the Vedanta Group. The Vedanta ESG Committee, in collaboration with our Group Sustainability and ESG function, oversees the execution and monitoring of initiatives under our 'Transforming for Good' agenda.

                                To ensure accountability and effective execution, we have established dedicated forums for management oversight and ESG-focused communities across all business units â€” ensuring accountability and ownership, while driving timely execution of sustainability initiatives.

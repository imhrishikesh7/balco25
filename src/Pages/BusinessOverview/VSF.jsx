                                    VSAP (Vedanta Sustainability Assurance Process) is a dedicated
                                    tool designed to assess sustainability risk and evaluate
                                    the alignment of our various businesses with the Vedanta
                                    Sustainability Framework. This assurance model consists of
                                    specialized modules covering key areas such as environmental
                                    impact, health and safety, community relations, and human rights.
                                    To maintain the robustness of our assurance system, we follow a
                                    structured approach. This includes monitoring and documenting
                                    corrective and preventive measures, as well as conducting periodic
                                    formal audits carried out by independent external experts.
                                    VSAP operates on an annual cycle, with oversight from the
                                    Sustainability Committee and the Executive Committee, who
                                    track performance outcomes and report findings to the Board.
                                    Where gaps are identified, we implement targeted management
                                    plans and corrective actions. The progress of these initiatives
                                    is continuously monitored, assessed, and recorded to ensure
                                    sustained improvement.
                                    Through this process, we identify and highlight both successes
                                    and failures, facilitating valuable opportunities for crosslearning. By sharing lessons learned across our organization, we
                                    continuously strive to improve our sustainability performance.
